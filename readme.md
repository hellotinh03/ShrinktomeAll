## Why

Minimize time spent on social media sites by making them smaller every 10th second.
This result in social medias being (more) useless after only a couple of minutes. Enjoy real life.


## Install

Only for Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers... for now.

- Get the latest .zip file from the [release](https://github.com/hellotinh03/ShrinktomeAll/releases) tab.
- Extract this zip file in a convenient folder (You can't delete this folder for as long as you want to use ShrinktomeAll. After all, you can't load an extension that you have deleted).
- Open Chrome/Chromium.
- Open chrome://extensions in a new tab.
- Enable "Developer mode" at the top-right.
- Click the "Load unpacked" button that just appeared.
- Select the folder where you just extracted the zip.


## Why is ShrinktomeAll not on the Chrome Web Store? (a.k.a begging for sympathy)

To be able to upload extensions to the Chrome Web Store, I'd have to pay Google 5$ just to make a developer account. This small extension I made for fun (and for me to stay focused on work more than spending hours on social medias) just isn't something that I, a third-worlder, would spend 5 bucks on.

If you are a capeless hero who has some spare money, you can download the .zip file, create a developer account, and upload it to the Chrome Web Store for others to install this thing more easily. The extension is all yours, although be sure to ask [the original author](https://github.com/terkelg) first.

ShrinktomeAll was forked from [Shrinktome](https://github.com/terkelg/shrinktome), and was modified to work with other social media sites.
